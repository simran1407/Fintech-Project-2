## *OVERVIEW*

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence involved with the creation of algorithms that can change itself without human intervention to produce an output by feeding itself through structured data. In this project, we created a model that makes a 7-day prediction for a particular stock/ticker using Machine Learning with Python. We were able to extract data from Yahoo Finance and run it through our prepared model to get the predictions that help us make buying and selling decisions on our stocks.

### *Import requests* 

(impoprts to be added from the notebook)

### *We used the following Machine Learning algorithms for our Stock Prediction model.
1. Decision Trees
2. Random Forests
3. 


## *RESULTS FROM THE PREDICTIONS*

After running the test data on the LSTM model, the predictions were pretty close to the actual readings. As you can see in the graph here, the predicted and the actual values are going hand in hand.
