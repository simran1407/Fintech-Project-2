# **THE DENARII TRADER: - motto - A daytrader trying to make a “day's wage” from a desktop brain!!**

## *OVERVIEW*

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence involved with the creation of algorithms that can change itself without human intervention to produce an output by feeding itself through structured data. In this project, we created a model that makes a 7-day prediction for a particular stock/ticker using different machine learning models.We were able to extract data from Yahoo Finance and run it through our prepared model to get the predictions that help us make buying and selling decisions on our stocks.

## *DATASET AND FEATURES*

The first step is to intitialize imports and prepare the data. We load the dataset and calculate the indicators- RSI, MACD and CMF. The dataset was downloaded from the YahooFinance. 

#### *Initial imports*

#### *Identifying the ticker we want to analyze (in our case, AAPL) and importing data from Yahoo Finance*

#### *Calculating and adding Indicators- RSI, MACD, CMF and Bollinger band signals to create our dataframe df* 

- RSI indicator (Relative Strength Index) is an indicator that we can use to measure if given asset is priced to high or too low. It is intended to chart the current and historical strength or weakness of a stock or market based on the closing prices of a recent trading period.

- MACD indicator stands for Moving Average Convergence Divergence. As the name suggests, indicator is evaluating two moving averages and the relation between them. It is calculated by subtracting the 26-period exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA.

- Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) is a technical analysis indicator used to measure Money Flow Volume over a set period of time. Money Flow Volume (a concept also created by Marc Chaikin) is a metric used to measure the buying and selling pressure of a security for single period.

### *MODEL 1- Forecasting stock prices using Prophet*

- Create a new dataframe for this model by selecting only the Close price from our original df.

- Fit the new dataframe in Prophet model and set the forecast period (in our case, 14 days).
- Display the dataframe with predicted prices where "yhat" is Close price, "yhat_lower" is lowest price for the day and "yhat_upper" is the highest price for the day.

### *Model 4: Predict Stock Prices Change using Random Forest*

- First, plot 1-day percentage change of adjusted close price in a histogram.

- Create an empty list to hold the feature names.
- In a for loop, use the ta-lib library SMA and RSI methods to calculate the SMA-14, SMA-30, SMA-50, & SMA-200 and also RSI-14, RSI-30, RSI-50, & RSI-200.
- Append the moving average and rsi variable names to the feature_names list.
- use the dataframe pct_change method again to calculate the daily volume change percentage and add the volume feature name to the list
-  shift price values forward to the next 7 indexes.
-  7-days future close price change percentage.
-  Drop nulls.
-  Assign feature_names list to variable X and 7-day future close price percentage column to variable y.
-  Set training size to 85% of the entire dataset and assign the first 85% of the feature values and target values to X_train and y_train, respectively.
-  Assign the last 15% of the feature values and target values to X_test and y_test, respectively.
-  Set a dictionary of parameters for our random forest model.

- Create an empty list to hold the values test_score for different parameter sets.
- Create a scikit-learn RandomForestRegressor object.
- Use a for-loop to iterate through the parameter value in the grid dictionary, apply the parameter set to the random forest model using the set_params function and fit the model with the training set, X_train & y_train.
- Use the NumPy argmax function to get the index of the highest test score from the list and print the best test score and parameter set.
- Fit X_train and y_train in the Random Forest model. Predict "y" and plot the preciction.

  ##### *Now evaluating our RF model*

- Use scikit-learn metrics module to calculate the MAE, MSE, and RMSE and then print them out.

- Now combine historical close price with ARIMA model's predicted close price and plot it. We used ARIMA predictions because ARIMA model gave us the most accurate/closest price to the actual close price.

### *Bollinger bands trading srategy and signals*

- Bollinger Bands are a type of price envelope developed by John BollingerOpens in a new window. (Price envelopes define upper and lower price range levels.) Bollinger Bands are envelopes plotted at a standard deviation level above and below a simple moving average of the price. Because the distance of the bands is based on standard deviation, they adjust to volatility swings in the underlying price. Bollinger Bands use 2 parameters, Period and Standard Deviations, StdDev. The default values are 20 for period, and 2 for standard deviations, although you may customize the combinations. Bollinger bands help determine whether prices are high or low on a relative basis. They are used in pairs, both upper and lower bands and in conjunction with a moving average. Further, the pair of bands is not intended to be used on its own. Use the pair to confirm signals given with other indicators.

- For this, we used the concatenated dataframe with the historical and 7 days of precicted prices.

### *Moving Average Crossover trading signal*

Moving Average (MA) Crossover indicator signals a crossover of a slower moving average or a longer period moving average by a faster moving average or a shorter period moving average. The MA crossover shows when the longer period moving average line cross a shorter period moving average line.

## *RESULTS FROM THE PREDICTIONS*

After running the test data on the LSTM model, the predictions were pretty close to the actual readings. As you can see in the graph here, the predicted and the actual values are going hand in hand.
